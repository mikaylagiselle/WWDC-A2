# WWDC-A2 : 'Mood Simulator'

This project includes a repository including the history of my code, proejct process and other general information contriubuting towards the finalisation of my prototype. Through the use of Python, I was able to code an interactive 'quiz style' visual output that offers varying visuals and games according to the user's mood. This data is collected through a simple quiz asked at the beginning and the visual representation is suited towards the answer. This prototype is aimed towards younger individuals who have difficulties expresing their emotions verbally, therefore the interactive and visual aspect of this project will enable them to engage whilst understanding the complexities of human emotion. 

**PROJECT AIM:**
This prototype aims to allow (mainly) children to express their emotions through a visual output. The information is collected through the user's responses and output through a visual feature coded in Processing.Org. This is due to children often finding difficulty in expressing themselves only verbally, therefore this prototype offers an alternate method of doing this. Furthermore, it can help stimulate positive feelings through the features- which are evidenced in the 'Calming' and 'Sad' functions. 

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**
This prototype is a beginner level coding project that has been executd through Processing.Org and Python , as it is the most appropriate software and language for achieving my creative and realistic goals. The use of Processing.org libraries have also been incorporated throughout the development of my project, offering straightforward methods of visual output. 

**FEATURES:**
The 'Mood Simulator' serves as a creative visual prototype aimed for kids struggling to express their emotions verbally. Through the 'quiz' based question: 'What is your mood?,' they are able to type in their answer to generate an artistic feature corresponding to their answer. The 3 recognised moods are: sad, happy and angry- with each having their own distinct features. If another mood is input, a default message: 'Thanks for contributing! Every mood is important!' is displayed onto the screen, with the option of inputting a different mood after 15 seconds, re routing back to the home page.

**SETUP:**
1. Ensure that the Processing.Org software has been installed onto your device, and is able to run seamlessly. You are able to do this from a google chrome browser- and download the appropriate Processing.Org platform according to what device you are using. E.g. for Macbook, Windows....
2. Make sure it is saved in a folder which you can easily access within your device.
3. Run the code by clicking the navy blue 'play' icon on the top left.
4. A new tab should pop up, with a pink 'wave like' animation moving.
5. Type in a mood. Recognised moods with a visual output" happy, sad and angry.
6. If 'happy': a popping circle game will appear, when these circles are popped, they turn into a smiley face. A scoreboard is also included to keep track. You are given 15 seconds before you return to the home page.
7. If 'sad': an animated sun will appear. To interact, click on the sun with your mouse to make it start spinning clockwise. To stop, click on it again. The sun will follow your mouse. You are given 15 seconds before you return to the home page.
8. If 'angry': a series of circles will appear in pastel shades, slowly increasing and decreasing. This a breathing exercise to follow to stimualte calmness. When the circle decreases, breathe in. When the circle increases, breathe out accordingly. You are given 15 seconds before you return to the home page.
